What does the script do?
-> The script changes the "Functional Status" attributes to "true" or "false" as the user selection for each attribute. 
-> It asks for the creaters name if the input XML file contains the "CreatedBy" tag.
-> It changes the date and time as per the present date and time in the output XML if the input XML contains the "DateTime" tag.


Instructions to use the script:
1. Create the "Input" and "Output" file at the location where the script is saved for the script to work. (Note: Folder name should be exactly same as mentioned in the quotes.)
2. Add your input .xml file in the Input folder. (Note: The Input folder should contain only ONE file at a time.)
3. Run the script.
4. Follow the instructions mentioned here and in the script for the required output.
